# USB Hi-Res Stereo Audio DAC using STM32F4xx "Black Pill" and PCM5102A or UDA1334ATS DAC

* USB Full Speed Class 1 Audio device, no driver installation required
* USB Bus powered
* Supports 24-bit audio streams with sampling frequency Fs = 44.1kHz, 48kHz or 96kHz
* USB Audio Volume (0dB to -96dB, 3dB steps) and Mute support
* Isochronous with endpoint feedback (3bytes, 10.14 format) to synchronize sampling frequency Fs
* Uses inexpensive [STM32F4xx "Black Pill"](https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F411CEU6-WeAct-Black-Pill-V2.0) module. Support for STM32F401CCU6 or STM32F411CEU6 black pill modules.
* Texas Instruments PCM5102A or Philips UDA1334ATS DAC modules

When the USB Audio DAC device is enumerated on plug-in, it reports its capabilities 
(audio class, sampling frequency options, bit depth). If you configure the host audio 
playback settings optimally (see section below), a native 96kHZ 24bit audio file will play unmodified, 
while a 44.1kHz or 48kHz 16bit stream will be resized to 24bits and resampled to 96kHz.

I now understand why there is a market for audiophile DACs with higher end headphones. 
I was given a pair of used Grado SR60 headphones a long time ago and was unimpressed. 
With my laptop and smartphone headphone outputs they didn't sound particularly remarkable. 
In fact, they were lacking in bass response. And they are bulky, with a heavy cable. So they
were gathering dust in storage.  
I retrieved the Grado headphones and tried them out with the USB DAC. The difference was astonishing.  
I'm no golden-ears audiophile, but the amount of detail and frequency response is impressive. 
Have a look at this 
[Cambridge Audio website](https://www.cambridgeaudio.com/row/en/blog/our-guide-usb-audio-why-should-i-use-it?fbclid=IwAR33SS0e_jNiQ1tBSOj29KdEOi1mhHn1r87bMg-VyAMmR2NeSmKETod-JkY#:~:text=Class%201%20will%20give%20you,step%20up%20to%20Class%202) 
comparing a dedicated USB Audio Class 1 DAC to a laptop headphone output. I have to agree with them.

Even 44.1kHz/16bit MP3 files sound much better when played back via the USB DAC. The Texas Instruments PCM5102A isn't 
marketed as an "audiophile" component, but it evidently can drive high-quality headphones well.
The Philips UDA1334ATS DAC module works just as well.

I normally re-cycle my prototype modules for new projects, but I am now using this setup as a 
permanent headphone driver.

For a "budget audiophile" experience, try the Venus Electronics Monk Plus in-ear phones with the 
USB DAC. These headphones are (and look) inexpensive, but they have high dynamic range
with no distortion at higher volumes.

# Software Development Environment
* Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS AMDx64
* [STM32CubeIDE v1.18.1](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).  This is only required for the compiler and build tool binaries. Download the Debian Linux Installer, extract the setup shell script and install using `sudo sh ./st-stm32cubeide_1.18.1_24813_20250409_2138_amd64.deb_bundle.sh`
. The tools will be installed in `/opt/st/stm32cubeide_1.18.1`
* [STLink V2 tools](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink/releases). Install the .deb package using `sudo apt install xxx.deb`. I used a cheap STLink V2 clone. It accepted a firmware upgrade from STM32CubeIDE and still works (YMMV). Connect ONLY the SCK, DIO and GND pins on the STLink V2 interface to the Black Pill dev board. Connect the dev board via USB cable  to the PC to supply 5V power.

## Build and flash  from Terminal 
* The project is a bare bones Makefile project and includes a snapshot of startup, linker script, CMSIS and HAL code from STM32 F4 firmware library v1.28.0. You do not need to install this library unless you want to create your own F4xx projects using the STM32 Cube IDE. 
* Edit `Makefile` to
  * Select STM32F411 / STM32F401 MCU
  * Select PCM5102A / UDA1334ATS DAC
  * Optional enable of MCLK output generation on STM32F411. Not required for PCM5102A and UDA1334ATS DACS. Use this for DACs that cannot generate MCK internally from the bit clock.
  * Enable diagnostic printout on serial UART port.
* [See this example](docs/example_build.txt) for the build steps :
    * Add the paths to the toolchain binaries to your environment `PATH` variable. Installing STLink V2 tools should have already added the path to `st-flash`.
    * Run `make clean`, `make all`, `make flash` to build and flash the binary. 

## Build and flash from STM32CubeIDE
 Copy the project source folder to the STM32CubeIDE workspace directory, then select `File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace`  to add the project to your workspace.
  
  Copy `Project -> Settings -> C/C++ build -> Environment -> PATH`  from any existing STM32CubeIDE project for 
  the F4xx MCU. Create and build a dummy project if you don't have one already. You will have to install the F4 firmware library 1.28.0 package via the `Help -> Manage Embedded Software Packages`.
  Then you can invoke the build  from the IDE.

# Optimizing Pulseaudio on Ubuntu 22.04

Edit `/etc/pulse/daemon.conf` as root
* Force re-sampling to 96kHz
* Resize to 24bits
* Use highest quality re-sampling algorithm
* Save file, log out and log in again for the changes to take effect

# Pipewire on Ubuntu 22.04LTS

Copy `/etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf` to `~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf`. Change the setting of
the default clock rate in context.properties :

```
    default.clock.rate          = 96000
```

Log out and after logging back in, play back an audio file via the USB DAC. Run
the command :

```
pactl list sinks
```

You should see confirmation that the audio is being resampled to 24bits and a sample rate of 96kHz.

# Endpoint Feedback mechanism

<img src="docs/feedback_endpoint_spec.png" />

Unfortunately, we do not have any means of measuring the actual Fs (accurate to 10.14 resolution)
generated by the PLLI2S peripheral on an SOF resolution interval of 1mS. So we calculate
a nominal Fs value by assuming the HSE crystal has 0ppm accuracy (no error), and use the PLLI2S N,R,
I2SDIV and ODD register values to compute the generated Fs value. For example when MCLK output
is disabled, the optimal register settings result in a value of 96.0144kHz.

<img src="docs/i2s_pll_settings.png" />

Since the USB host is asynchronous to the PLLI2S Fs clock generator, the incoming Fs rate of audio packets will be slightly different. We use
a circular buffer of audio packets to accommodate the difference in incoming and outgoing Fs. 

The USB driver writes incoming audio packets to this buffer while the I2S transmit DMA reads from this buffer. We start I2S playback when the buffer is half full, and then try to maintain this position, i.e. the difference between the write pointer and read pointer should optimally be half of the buffer size.

Any change to this pointer distance implies the USB host and I2S playback Fs values are not in sync.
To correct this, we implement a PID style feedback mechanism where we report an ideal Fs feedback frequency
based on the deviation from the nominal pointer distance. We want to avoid the write process overwriting the unread packets, and we also want to minimize the oscillation in Fs due to unnecessarily large corrections.

This is a debug log of changes in Fs due to the implemented mechanism. The first datum is the SOF frame counter, the second is the pointer distance in samples, the third is the feedback Fs. As you can see, the feedback is able to minimize changes in pointer distance AND oscillations in Fs frequency.

# Latency

I have not measured the actual latency. The USB protocol stack and F4xx USB driver firmware will have inherent latency and I have no idea how to estimate this. 
The additional latency introduced by this firmware application is half the circular buffer size (in stereo samples) 
multiplied by the inverse of the sampling frequency Fs.

A single stereo sample uses 2x3 = 6 bytes. 
The estimated latency in seconds is ((Circular_Buffer_Size_Bytes/2) / 6) *  (1/Sampling_Freq_Hz)

The relevant configuration parameter is `AUDIO_OUT_PACKET_NUM` in `drivers/usb/Class/AUDIO/Inc/usbd_audio.h`.
